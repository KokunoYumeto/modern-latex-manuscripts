# Modern LaTeX Editions of Mathematics Manuscripts

This repository is the GitHub working front door for an open project to produce modern, inspectable LaTeX editions and translation drafts of older mathematics and physics manuscripts.

The durable release files live on Zenodo. GitHub is for coordination: manifests, issue tracking, contribution notes, scripts, and lightweight source snapshots where practical. Large PDFs, raw scan archives, and full provenance packages should be downloaded from the linked Zenodo records.

## Workflow

The detailed provenance and review workflow is in [workflow notes](docs/workflow.md).

1. Public scans and candidate works are identified and downloaded.
2. Automated transcription systems produce initial TeX drafts.
3. ChatGPT/Codex and other agents audit, compile, repair, organize, and translate.
4. Reader PDFs stay front-facing; TeX, source scans, provenance, audits, and raw source packets are kept in artifact ZIPs.
5. Clean releases are organized by author, work, or coherent corpus and published to Zenodo under CC0 where possible.

## Quality Status

These are working scholarly drafts, not final critical editions. PDF checks verify that files open and extract text; they do not certify mathematical correctness. The [quality rubric](docs/quality-rubric.md) explains the difference between preserved files, readable drafts, source-check candidates, and proofread editions. The most useful contributions are source comparison, theorem numbering checks, LaTeX repair, missing diagram/table repair, and translation proofreading.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for correction workflow and [release checklist](docs/release-checklist.md) for publication hygiene. Issues and pull requests should be specific: name the work, page/section, current file, source witness, and proposed correction.
